		<h3>Architecture – Major Description</h3>
<h3>Architecture is the art and science of designing and constructing buildings and spaces that are functional, aesthetically meaningful, and socially responsive. It integrates creative design with technical knowledge, sustainability, and an understanding of cultural and historical contexts. Architects shape the built environment to improve how people live, work, and interact with their surroundings.</h3>
